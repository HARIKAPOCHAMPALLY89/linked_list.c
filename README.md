# Linked List Implementation in C

## Overview
This project implements a **Singly Linked List** using the C programming language.
It demonstrates core data structure concepts such as dynamic memory allocation
and pointer manipulation.

## Concepts Covered
- Structures (`struct`)
- Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`)
- Pointers and pointer to pointer
- Traversal of linked list

## Features
- Create a node
- Insert node at the end (append)
- Insert node at the beginning (prepend)
- Delete a node
- Display the linked list
- Basic CRUD operations

## Applications
- Data Structures learning
- BTech / CSE academic projects
- Interview and viva preparation
